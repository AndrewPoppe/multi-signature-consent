# Multi Signature Consent
A REDCap External Module that allows you to define one or more instruments.  When they are complete, a combined PDF with signatures (and other fields) from those instruments is generated, saved to a field in the project, and also to the file repository for the project (like a normal e-consent PDF).

You can couple this with an Alert and Notification to then send a copy of the combined PDF to a participant.
